Phanfiq.ai project for Surreal World Assets Buildathon
Phanfiq.ai
"Protect your models. Keep the lawyers happy."
🏆 SWA Film Festival & Story Protocol Hackathon Submission
Phanfiq.ai is a Story-Protocol-native decentralized IP fan-creation engine. We turn the "Unlicensed Data Kaiju" of Generative AI into a structured, legal, and profitable ecosystem for creators and IP holders.
📝 Project Description
In a future where every AI model eats data, most cities forget to check the licenses. Phanfiq.ai is the shield.
Phanfiq is a two-sided platform built directly on Story Layer-1 and the Proof-of-Creativity (PoC) protocol. It allows:
1.	Creators/IP Owners to onboard existing IP, set clear "Programmable IP Licenses" (PIL), and earn multi-generational royalties.
2.	Fans to generate bespoke AI art, fiction, and video using that IP, instantly registering their new creation as a "Child Asset" that pays homage (and royalties) to the original444.
We transform the "Unlicensed Data Kaiju" into a properly licensed asset graph.
🔗 IP Registration Proof (SWA Film Festival)
We have registered our submission videos as IP Assets on the Story Protocol testnet, proving the provenance of our own promotional material.

🛠 The Build & Architecture
Phanfiq isn't just a UI; it is an interface for the Story IP Graph.
The "Asset Graph"
As visualized in our submission video, Phanfiq restructures unstructured data into a graph of ownership.
Workflow & Tech Stack
Our "Perpetuum Mobile" of creativity follows this flow:
1.	Generation (AI Layer):
o	Video: Generated using Runway Gen-3 and Luma Dream Machine.
o	Visuals: Characters and UI mockups generated via Midjourney & Stable Diffusion.
o	Audio: Soundtracks composed via Suno & Udio.
o	Text/Script: Co-written with LLMs (Claude/GPT-4).
2.	Registration (Story Protocol Layer):
o	Parent IP: The original character or universe is registered as a root IP Asset.
o	Licensing (PIL): The creator attaches a Programmable IP License.
	Example: "Commercial Remix License" allows fans to monetize derivatives.
o	Remixing: When a fan generates a new video or story, Phanfiq automatically registers it as a Child IP Asset.
3.	Monetization (Royalty Module):
o	The Royalty Module is configured to execute deterministic splits.
o	Flow: Revenue from the derivative automatically flows upstream to the Parent IP and the Platform.
🧩 Story Protocol Integration Details
We utilize the full Story Protocol stack to ensure compliance and monetization:
•	Proof of Creativity (PoC): Used to mint every fan creation as a traceable asset.
•	Programmable IP License (PIL): We implement "License Shields" that protect users from DMCA risks by wrapping creations in legally binding on-chain terms.
•	Grouping Module: Used to cluster assets into "Universes" (e.g., a specific Anime world or Brand).
•	Dispute Module: Integrated to handle "Copyright Strikes" on-chain, resolving conflicts transparently.
🚀 Future Roadmap
•	Q1 2026: Launch "Universe Groups" allowing brands to open their IP for verified fan-fiction.
•	Q2 2026: Integrate "Data Use Fees" where models pay micro-transactions to train on Phanfiq-registered datasets.
•	Q3 2026: Fractionalized IP-Fi (IP DAOs) allowing community ownership of successful story branches.
